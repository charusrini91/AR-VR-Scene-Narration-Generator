# AR-VR-Scene-Narration-Generator
It’s designed to receive Unity scene metadata (JSON of objects, tags, descriptions), call a text-generation model (OpenAI by default) with a well-crafted narration prompt, and return human-friendly narration. I also include an optional Text-to-Speech (TTS) step using gTTS so you can immediately produce audio narration.
